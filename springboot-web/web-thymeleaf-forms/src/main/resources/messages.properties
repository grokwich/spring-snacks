# The Validation framework will use messages.properties by default if present, 
# but the Validation msg integration is adapted to the i18n message bundle api.
# So just simple interpolation of parameters by number.
# One nice behavior of the simple message api is auto-key generation.
# By default, you do not need to be explicit about the constraint annotation specifying a message key. 
# The default key convention is <constraint-name>.<command-name>.<command-field> 
# Normally the command-name is the Command Class Name.
# WARN!
# But if the command-name is aliased by a @ModelAttribute("command-name-alias"), 
# then the alias must be used as the command-name.
# example: 
# // @Valid @ModelAttribute("command") FormCommand command,
# In this example command-name -> "command" (rather than 'formCommand').
# The default key in this case is demonstrated below by the @Size validation message. 
#

Size.command.textareaField=The Textarea Field must have at least {2} characters, but no mare than {1}
